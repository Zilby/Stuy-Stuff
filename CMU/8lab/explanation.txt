Project Name: Wizzy

Wizzy is an original platformer game with sprites created by myself (although I did use base models for all of them except the projectiles, eg: Legend of Zelda's Link). The objective is to get to the top of the screen as fast as possible before the platforms disappear. You may encounter enemies along the way. *Note, all levels are beatable, although some may be difficult for newer platformers (level 6 is quite hard). There are 8 levels total, try to beat them all!
*This will run slower on the cmu computers, so if the gameplay seems slow, this may be why*

Controls: 
Arrow keys for jumping, and moving left to right.
Spacebar fires your projectile, only while on the ground. Holding it will give a more continuous fire.  
P will pause the game. 
R will always restart the game
(S will skip a level)

Special Stuff:
If you look closely, you will note that there is a walking animation for the player sprite, (easier to see while on a platform). 
Colors for platforms have been randomized on an RBG scale for purples.
