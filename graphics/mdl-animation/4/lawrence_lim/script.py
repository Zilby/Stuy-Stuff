"""========== script.py ==========

  This is the only file you need to modify in order
  to get a working mdl project (for now).

  my_main.c will serve as the interpreter for mdl.
  When an mdl script goes through a lexer and parser, 
  the resulting operations will be in the array op[].

  Your job is to go through each entry in op and perform
  the required action from the list below:

  frames: set num_frames for animation

  basename: set name for animation

  vary: manipluate knob values between two given frames
        over a specified interval

  set: set a knob to a given value
  
  setknobs: set all knobs to a given value

  push: push a new origin matrix onto the origin stack
  
  pop: remove the top matrix on the origin stack

  move/scale/rotate: create a transformation matrix 
                     based on the provided values, then 
		     multiply the current top of the
		     origins stack by it.

  box/sphere/torus: create a solid object based on the
                    provided values. Store that in a 
		    temporary matrix, multiply it by the
		    current top of the origins stack, then
		    call draw_polygons.

  line: create a line based on the provided values. Store 
        that in a temporary matrix, multiply it by the
	current top of the origins stack, then call draw_lines.

  save: call save_extension with the provided filename

  display: view the image live

"""======== second_pass( commands ) ==========

  In order to set the knobs for animation, we need to keep
  a seaprate value for each knob for each frame. We can do
  this by using an array of dictionaries. Each array index
  will correspond to a frame (eg. knobs[0] would be the first
  frame, knobs[2] would be the 3rd frame and so on).

  Each index should contain a dictionary of knob values, each
  key will be a knob name, and each value will be the knob's
  value for that frame.

  Go through the command array, and when you find vary, go 
  from knobs[0] to knobs[frames-1] and add (or modify) the
  dictionary corresponding to the given knob with the
  appropirate value.
