CHARACTERS:
For now, characters will be limited to Warrior and Wizard. In the beginning of the game, you will have the opportunity to choose between the two; a Warrior is limited to attacking with physical weapons, while a Wizard attacks with spells. 

STATS:
There are three battle stats that each character has: Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence. Each character starts with 8 points in each stat, with 10 more to be allotted at the player's choice. 
Strength: Strength will be used to determine if a character is able to carry his weapon and/or armor. 
Dexterity: Dexterity will be used to calculate the dodge chance as well as who will attack first in a battle. It may also factor in fleeing.
Intelligence: Intelligence is the Wizard equivalent to Strength. Players will only be able to use certain spells if they have enough Intelligence.

Aside from the three battle stats, there are three more stats that characters have: Health, Mana, and Experience. At the beginning of the game, characters start with 20 Health, 0 Experience, and Mana is proportional to Intelligence. 
Health: Health is used to determine how many hits your character can take before dying. When your Health gets to zero, you die.
Mana: Mana is used to determine how many spells a player can cast before losing energy. The maximum amount of mana is calculated by the character's Intelligence stat. Mana will have the ability to regenerate over time.
Experience: Experience will be used to level up. Every time you defeat an enemy, you get a certain amount of experience points, and when you get to 100 experience points, your player levels up. When you level up, you get two extra stat points to allot to your battle stats.

Another variable, limited to NPCs, is Distance. Distance is used to determine whether the enemy is able to attack you or not, as well as the flee rate, should you decide to flee.

BATTLE:
When you encounter an enemy, you will enter a battle. In battle, you will have the options to attack, use item, or flee. Battle will be determined using a turn-based system. Dexterity will be used to calculate who act first.
Attack: Attacking either physically or with magic will determine on the weapon. The weapon's strength, along with the target's armor, will be factors into calculating how much damage is done. 
Use Item: The effects of Using an Item depends on the actual item. The item will be lost after use.
Flee: Fleeing a battle will end the battle immediately. Flee Chance is calculated by Dexterity multiplied by Distance. If the Flee Chance is greater or equal to the sum of the rolls of three six-sided dice, then the player successfully flees. If not, then the player loses a turn, and the enemy has the ability to either attack or advance.
