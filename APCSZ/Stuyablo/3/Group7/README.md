Period 3, Group 7

Michelle Chan, Kyler Chase, Eric Cheang, Andrew Lee


CHARACTER:
Player and non-player characters will either be WIZARD or WARRIOR. He/she will start out with dexterity, strength, health, and experience.
These variables increase when the PC hits the NPC.
Theyg will decrease when the PC gets hit by the NPC.

ATTACK:
Three 6-sided die will be rolled. If the player's dexterity is greater or equal to the sum of the roll, then he/she can attack.
The result will be a hit, and this increase the player's strength, experience, and dexterity.
Else, it would be a miss.

FLEE: 
If the dexterity is less than the sum of the rolled die, then the player can flee. Fleeing will decrease the player's health and experience, since it's such a cowardly act.


EXPERIENCE:
Players will have an increase in experience, and once it reaches its limit, it will reset back to 0. This indicates that the player has leveled up.
For the WIZARD class, one point will be added to a random attribute. (It's a gift!)
