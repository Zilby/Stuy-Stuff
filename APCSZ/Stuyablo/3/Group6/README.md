Period 3, Group 6

Sydney Caputo, Eric Kolbusz, Rushil Kumar, Mary Taft

Characters:

Each character has health, dexterity, strength, and intelligence. Each of those attributes is assigned to a character according to that character's strengths and weaknesses; however, every instance of a new character will have a slight variation of those attributes.

Our PCs are a Warrior and a Thief.
Our NPCs are an Ogre and a Goblin Mage.


Combat System:

The success of a character hitting its opponent is based on the attacker's dexterity.  Three six-sided dice are rolled, and if the sum of their results are less than or equal to the attacker's dexterity, the hit is successful.

The damage inflicted on an opponent when a hit is successful is based on the attacker's strength.  Strength relates to the inflicted damage in different ways, depending on the type of character which is attacking.


Fleeing:

Fleeing is based on the dexterities of both parties.  Usually, if a character tries to flee, it will be successful if it is fast enough.
