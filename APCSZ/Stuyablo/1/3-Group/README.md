Combat System
-------------

How a character is represented

* Minimum for str, dex, and int is 8
* There is no cap
* Health starts at 50 if str is 8
* Health scales with strength (4 health per extra point in str)
* For a human, each attribute starts at 8 and you have 8 additional points to distribute
* 4 attribute points per level

Fighting

* We will be using a coordinate system
* It will be turn based, and the character with higher dex will move first
* Chance of hitting is determined by rolling a number lower than dex out of level + 9
* Chance for shooting ranged weapons will be rolling a number lower than dex - distance between chars out of level + 9
* When we have an inventory, weapons will add to the characters' damage
* Weapons will have a range
* Range is determined by the sum of the difference in their x and y
* Damage is based on str for warriors and thieves, and int for mages
* Defense is generated by armor
* You subtract your defense + randomizer from the raw damage to get your final damage
* Dodging is based on rolling a number lower than the opponent's dex out of your dex
* Fleeing is based on rolling a number lower than the opponent's dex + (0.3 * range) out of your dex

Encounter system

* 50% chance of encountering an npc
* 3 options - fight, talk, ignore
