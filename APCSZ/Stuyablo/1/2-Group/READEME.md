CHARACTERS

Characters have strength, intelligence, dexterity, and movement rate stats made upon creation. Their health is dependent on their strength stat. A playable character can choose their stats while npc have randomly generated stats, which get higher as the game progresses. A character's movement rate is generally 10, with few exceptions. A character will always have a class.

ENCOUNTERS

When the player first meets another character, they have an option to talk or fight. Most of the time, fighting occurs. In a battle, the person with higher dexterity goes first. Dexterity works in this game very similarly to how it works in fantasy trip. Every character has a basic attack, that just does their strength as damage. However, every class also offers extra skills for the character to use, which have a damage bonus, specific range, and can be either physical or magical. In addition to attacks, a character can also flee from battle or try moving to gain a advantageous position. Fleeing works better the further away you are and A character can still attack or flee after they move as long as they don't go their full movement rate.

END OF BATTLE

A battle ends when a character either dies or flees. In PvP either one will cause the game to end, where as in PvE the game will continue if the player flees, or if the enemy flees or dies. When a character flees or dies, they give experience based off of their stat total. If the character fled, they will still give off XP but it will also factor in how much health they had left at the time. Once 100 XP is gained, the player can add a point to any stat they want. They're going to need it, because enemies only get harder as the game goes on. How long can you survive?

Note: The Playable classes in the game are Warrior and Wizard. The Warrior's skills are a Sword Slice, Spear Stab, and Bow and Arrow. The Wizard can cast Fireballs, Spells, Dark Magic, or hit people with a Staff.
