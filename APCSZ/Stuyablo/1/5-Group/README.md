Attributes

A PC can use user input to generate the characters or you can do it randomly. 
An NPC should randomly set the attributes. Other races can have different starting points and point allotments. 
Likewise you can start specific characters with certain strengths and weaknesses.

Combat

For distance weapons, the in the real game you subtracted 1 from your dexterity for the purposes of the roll per grid space travelled. 
You would make the adjustment based on the distance between the two characters.

Damage is based on the weapon you use and the weapons you can use are based on strength, k.
