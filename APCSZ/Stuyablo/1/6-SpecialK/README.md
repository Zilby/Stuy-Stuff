GROUP 6 - SPECIAL K
      Spencer Weiss, Coby Goldberg, Ling Dong, Nadia Saleh, Vincent Wong

//CHARACTER REPRESENTATION
We will have 5 different characters, each with different specialities
   aka. certain attributes will be higher than others in the beginning
They will have dexterity, strength, and defense, starting at a minimum of 8 each. 8 additional points will vary based on the character.
They will also have 8 points to assign - this is for the player to decide.
The damage output of the character will be the attack power/4 subtracted by the enemy's attack power/4, or a larger amount if the character crit strikes. 

The characters gain health and certain attributes upon ending a battle. When they die, the game ends.

Upon defeat of an opponent, the player will gain attributes depending on the attribute that the opponent specialized in.

//COMBAT
To simulate the three six sided dice, there will be three Random numbers generated, each with a value from 0-5. 
These numbers will decide if the player gets a crit strike, or even hits at all.

The player can choose to talk to the enemy during the fight - if their charm is high enough and if they are lucky, they can damage the enemy this way. However, this also makes the enemy mad and forces a battle.


Or, the player can also TRY to flee

//ETC
There are options to talk to the nearest NPC, see current stats, and exit the game.
