Player characters, archer, warrior and wizar, will begin the game off with a strength and health of eight that can increase to sixteen. Dexterity varies between the characters. Non-player charcters such as ogre and Moran will randomly generate their strength and health. 

It will be turn based. Players will only be able to attack other NPCS. In order to hit, the players must role their dexterity or less and be close to their opponent in order to attack. They will also be able to flee when they are prompted.
