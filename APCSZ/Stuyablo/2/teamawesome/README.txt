We will not be using a map with x and y coordinates. 
Some instance variables we would have would be: protected String name; protected int health; protected int dexterity;
protected int intelligence; protected int mana; protected int strength; etc.

Each turn would be an encounter with a monster, 100% of the time. 
The game would be run by nested while loops: while the player's health is greater than 0, keep playing, and while the enemies health is greater than 0, keep fighting. 

If the enemies health drops below 0, a new monster is faced. 
During the fight, a scanner could be used to ask whether the user wants to use a spell, attack basically or run away. 

Health would be used to see if the character is still alive. 

Dexterity would determine speed accuracy Intelligence would determine magic damage, damage done by spells. Each spell would cost a set amount of mana, and it might have a 
special effect, like life steal or something. Strength would determine how much extra damage is dealt by basic attacks. 

In our basic game, there would be 100% flee. 

However, as we progress, we could take experience and other variables into account to make the chance of flight and attack more accurate.
