#### Layout
This game takes place on a 2 dimensional plane with an x,y coordinate representing the location of the player and all enemies. Players are given a list of things they can do each turn, such as moving, going into combat with an enemy, getting their status or distributing skill points.

#### Stats
Players start with 8 points on each attribute listed below. In addition, the player will receive 8 skill points to distribute amongst the three attributes. On level up, each attribute will increase by 1 and the player will receive 2 skill points to add to whichever attribute they like. Also, health will be regenerated on level up.

- **Strength** - Used by warriors to deal more damage and by all classes to represent *max health*
- **Dexterity** - Used by rogues to deal more damage and by all classes to represent *hit chance*
- **Intelligence** - Used by wizards to deal more damage

#### Combat
When getting into combat, the player and the enemy will continue attacking until the player or the enemy dies, with the player having special attacks that occur randomly. Hit chance is dependent on a 3 dice roll, but most of the time, hit chance is based on the player's dexterity compared to that of the enemy. When the player starts running out of life, an option is given to continue fighting or flee. Fleeing is based on the class that the user has selected with rogues having the highest chance, followed by wizards and warriors. 

#### Enemies
There are two kinds of enemies: Ogres and Mr. Moran. Ogres are weaker and don't deal as much damage. Enemies also start out with 8 points on each attribute and 2n points will be randomly distributed amongst the three attributes (n representing the level of the player).
