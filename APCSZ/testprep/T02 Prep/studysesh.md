### Boolean
true or false?

built into java (lowercase t and f)
**They are not strings!!**

`System.out.println(4>3)  ---->  true`

#### Operators
>, >=			Greater than
<, <=			Less than
==				Equality (NOT THE SAME AS =)
				**one equals sign sets a value, two compares**
!=				Not equals
&&				And
||				or
!				not


### If Statements
`if (<boolean expression>){
	//Do this stuff
	}`

*single statement doesn't need a squigly bracket*

2 Ways of writing them:
`if (<boolean expression>){
	//do this;
	//and this;
	//and also this;
	}`
	
OR

`if (<boolean expression>){
	//do this;
	//and this;
	}
else (<another boolean expression>) {
	//dothis
	//and this
	}`
	
(else if works too!)



### Shorthands:
*note: DONT USE THESE IN THE AP TEST!!! The graders are not so compueter savvy... and might not know them.*
a += b		a = a + b
a -= b     	a = a - b 
a /= b	  	a = a / b
a *= b	  	a = a * b
